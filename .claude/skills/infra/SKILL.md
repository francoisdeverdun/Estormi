# Infrastructure & Scripts

## When to Use

- Modifying `scripts/daily_ingestion.sh`.
- Working with launchd plists in `scripts/`.
- Setting up the Distillation tooling (`scripts/setup_distill.sh` — MLX venv +
  llama.cpp converter under the data dir; see `docs/architecture/distillation.md`).
- Running health checks, smoke tests, or end-to-end validation.
- Understanding the WhatsApp Rust sidecar integration.
- Modifying the Makefile, release helpers, installer, or bundled Python setup.
- Working with ingestion pipeline logs.
- Rebuilding / installing / restarting the packaged macOS app.

## What needs a rebuild

The macOS app ships as a Tauri bundle with a bundled uvicorn sidecar, but
**the backend Python runs from the source tree** — `packages/estormi_server/server/jobs.py`
resolves `ROOT` from `ESTORMI_REPO_ROOT` when set, otherwise from
`Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent.parent.parent` (four `.parent` hops:
`jobs.py` is four levels below the repo root). So:

| Edit | Action |
|---|---|
| `packages/estormi_ingestion/**`, `scripts/**`, `packages/connectors/**`, `prompts/**` | Hot — next pipeline run picks them up. No rebuild. |
| `packages/estormi_server/**` | Sidecar restart needed — run `zsh scripts/build.sh`. The uvicorn process is bundled and long-lived. |
| `packages/web-ui/**`, `packages/ui-kit/**` | Rebuild — Vite output is baked into the bundle. `zsh scripts/build.sh` runs `make bundle` which depends on `frontend-build`. |
| `assets/**` (brand, fonts, source-icons) | Rebuild — bundled as Tauri resources; `zsh scripts/build.sh` re-copies them into the app. |
| `packages/memory_core/**` | Sidecar restart (same as `packages/estormi_server/**`). |
| `apps/estormi-macos/**` | Full rebuild. |
| `apps/estormi-ios/**` | Native SwiftUI build — `cd apps/estormi-ios && xcodegen generate && open Estormi.xcodeproj` (then ⌘R in Xcode). Not part of the macOS bundle. |

`zsh scripts/build.sh` is the canonical rebuild entry.
It runs `make bundle` (Vite + Tauri), kills the running app via
`pkill -f '/Applications/Estormi.app'` (also kills any in-flight pipeline run
under the bundled Python — fine for normal rebuilds), copies the new
`.app` to `/Applications/`, and relaunches. Verify with
`curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health`.

Auto-commit is opt-in via `ESTORMI_AUTO_COMMIT=1`; default is off so
half-finished work isn't swept into a `chore: pre-build sweep` commit.

## Engines & scheduling

Three engines (`ENGINES = ("ingestion", "briefing", "distill")` in
`packages/estormi_server/server/jobs.py`) are all serialized through one
DB-backed mutex (`memory_core.engine_lock`) — only one runs at a time. The
FastAPI APScheduler owns every cron; each engine runs as a child process.
Canonical reference: `docs/architecture/engines.md`.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    sched["FastAPI APScheduler<br/>(lifespan.py · schedulers.py)"]
    lock{{"engine_lock<br/>one engine at a time"}}

    sched -->|"schedule_cron 0 2 * * *<br/>+ startup catch-up"| ing
    sched -->|"briefing_schedule_cron 0 7 * * *<br/>+ startup catch-up"| brief
    sched -->|"distill_schedule_cron 0 3 * * 0<br/>off the daily path"| dist

    subgraph daily["Daily path"]
        ing["Ingestion<br/>scripts/daily_ingestion.sh"]
        brief["Briefing<br/>estormi_briefing.run_briefing"]
    end
    dist["Distill (Apple Silicon)<br/>estormi_distill.run_distill"]

    ing --> lock
    brief --> lock
    dist --> lock
```

A briefing composes identically whether or not Distill has ever run. The
sources panel and `make daily-dag` also trigger Ingestion on demand.

### Source ingestion pipeline

The Ingestion engine dispatches stages through the connector registry:
`daily_ingestion.sh` derives its stage list from `python -m connectors stages`
and runs each via `python -m connectors run <stage>`.

Ingestion-script paths below are under `packages/estormi_ingestion/`:

| `dag_order` | Stage | Default | Ingestion script |
|:---:|---|:---:|---|
| 1 | `notes` | yes | `packages/estormi_ingestion/apple_notes/watch_and_ingest.sh` |
| 2 | `mail` | yes | `packages/estormi_ingestion/apple_mail/watch_and_ingest.sh` |
| 4 | `gcal` | no | `packages/estormi_ingestion/google_calendar/sync.py` |
| 5 | `reminders` | yes | `packages/estormi_ingestion/reminders/watch_and_ingest.sh` |
| 6 | `imessage` | yes | `packages/estormi_ingestion/imessage/watch_and_ingest.sh` |
| 7 | `whatsapp` | yes | `packages/estormi_ingestion/whatsapp/watch_and_ingest.sh` |
| 8 | `documents` | yes | `packages/estormi_ingestion/documents/ingest_documents.py` |
| 11 | `knowledge` | yes | `packages/estormi_ingestion/knowledge/ingest_world.py` (world corpus: RSS / YouTube) |
| 12 | `whoop` | no | `packages/estormi_ingestion/whoop/sync.py` |

The default nightly pipeline runs the **seven** stages marked *default*.
`gcal` and `whoop` carry `default_stage=False`, so they run only on demand
(`connectors stages --all` lists all nine). The `knowledge` stage ingests the
external *world* corpus and **is** a source stage — distinct from the Briefing
composition engine (`estormi_briefing.run_briefing`), which is not a pipeline
stage.

## Pipeline Logs

`daily_ingestion.sh` writes logs under `$ESTORMI_DATA_DIR/logs/`:

```text
estormi-daily-dag.log                       # canonical live log (rotated at the start of each run)
estormi-daily-dag-error.log                 # stderr/error log (surfaced by the UI's "Open error log" button)
estormi-stage-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<stage>.log   # per-stage log
```

Run/stage *state* is recorded in the canonical `dag_runs` / `dag_stages`
SQLite tables via the `memory_core.dag_state` CLI. The Ingestion-page pipeline
widget and `GET /api/pipeline` read those tables (`packages/estormi_server/services/pipeline_status.py`),
not the raw logs. The cross-process "one engine at a time" guard is the
DB-backed `engine_lock` (`memory_core.engine_lock`) — the shell DAG and the
server both acquire it, replacing the former `/tmp` pid file.

## Key Environment Variables

```bash
ESTORMI_DATA_DIR              # Data directory
MCP_SERVER_URL               # API endpoint used by ingestion scripts
MCP_SERVER_HOST              # Source-server Uvicorn host before startup
MCP_SERVER_PORT              # Source-server Uvicorn port before startup
STAGES                       # Space-separated pipeline stages
PY                           # Python interpreter path
WHATSAPP_SYNC_ONCE           # Whether WhatsApp stage triggers bounded sidecar sync
WHATSAPP_SYNC_ONCE_SECONDS   # Bounded WhatsApp sync duration
ESTORMI_WHATSAPP_ALWAYS_ON    # Keep WhatsApp sidecar bot running continuously
DAG_LOG_DIR                  # Directory read by pipeline log parser
```

## launchd Agents

The daily ingestion pipeline is **not** a launchd agent. It is scheduled in-process by the
FastAPI server's APScheduler (default cron `0 2 * * *`), with a startup
catch-up in `packages/estormi_server/server/lifespan.py` for the case the app wasn't running
at cron time. This keeps the pipeline's macOS-permission grants attributed to
Estormi rather than a detached launchd job — see the permission preflight in
`packages/estormi_server/server/permission_preflight.py`. `make install-agents` retires any
previously-installed `app.estormi.local.daily-dag` agent.

The one remaining optional launchd plist lives in `scripts/`:

| Plist | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `app.estormi.local.weekly-report.plist` | Runs `weekly_report.sh` |

Manage it through the Makefile:

```bash
make install-agents
make agents
make uninstall-agents
```

## WhatsApp Integration

WhatsApp is handled by the `apps/estormi-macos/src/whatsapp/` module, a `whatsapp-rust`
task inside the Tauri binary. It exposes a local Axum API at `127.0.0.1:9877`.

The ingestion shell triggers `/api/whatsapp/sync-once` by default, then ingests
staged `.txt` and `.meta.json` files through `ingest_conversations.py`.

## Makefile Targets

```bash
make start             # Start FastAPI from source
make health            # Health + freshness checks
make daily-dag         # Run the source ingestion pipeline
make test              # Pytest with coverage
make test-suite        # Installed-machine validation
make lint              # Ruff check and format check
make bundle-python     # Build bundled Python runtime
make bundle            # Build unsigned local app bundle/zip
make tag V=vX.Y        # Update badge, commit, tag, push (the Release workflow then builds + publishes the DMG)
```

## How to Add a New Pipeline Stage

A new stage *is* a new data source: the connector registry
(`packages/connectors/`) is the single source of truth and `daily_ingestion.sh`
hardcodes nothing. Follow the **"How to Add a New Data Source"** recipe in the
`ingestion` skill — register a `ConnectorSpec` with `dag_stage=True` and a
`dag_order`, then run `make test`.

## CI Workflows

GitHub Actions are split by stack so each PR only pays for what it touches.
The repo runs on the **free-tier 2,000 Actions-minutes/month** budget, so heavy
or rarely relevant jobs are path-filtered or scheduled, not run on every PR.

| Workflow | Trigger | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/test.yml` | push to `main` + PR (skips docs-only) | Python lint, unit, integration, e2e, contract, runtime suite + web-ui Vitest & Playwright e2e (`frontend` job). Full-coverage + badge commit gated to `push` on `main`. |
| `.github/workflows/rust.yml` | push/PR with `apps/estormi-macos/**` changes | Rust fmt, clippy, cargo-audit. Caches `cargo-audit` binary. |
| `.github/workflows/js.yml` | push/PR with `packages/web-ui/**`, `packages/ui-kit/**`, or root JS manifests | `pnpm -r typecheck` + `pnpm -r test`. |
| `.github/workflows/ios.yml` | push/PR with `apps/estormi-ios/**`, `packages/ui-kit/src/briefing.css`, or `.github/workflows/ios.yml` | `xcodegen generate` + `xcodebuild build` + `xcodebuild test` on macOS. |
| `.github/workflows/security.yml` | every PR + nightly schedule + push to `main` (security-relevant paths) | bandit, pip-audit, detect-secrets, TruffleHog history scan. Runs on every PR so a secret/CVE can't reach `main`. |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | git tags `v*` | macOS DMG build (10× minute cost — tag-gated only). |

Hard rules when editing CI:

- **Never put `pull_request:` on `release.yml`.** The DMG build consumes
  disproportionate minutes; it is tag-gated only. (`security.yml` intentionally
  runs on every PR — a secret/CVE introduced in a PR must not reach `main`.)
- **Never duplicate the lint job.** `python-lint` in `test.yml` is the single
  ruff gate; do not re-add a standalone `lint.yml`.
- **Path-filter heavy stacks.** Rust and JS jobs only run when their stack
  actually changed. If you add a new heavy job, give it `paths:` or move it
  to `security.yml`'s schedule.
- **Never run `python-full` (pytest + coverage + badge commit) on PRs.** The
  per-layer jobs (`test-unit`/`integration`/`e2e`/`contract`) already cover PR
  signal — running the suite twice doubled the bill historically.
- **Workflow renames are contracts.** `tests/contract/test_quality_contracts.py`
  asserts on workflow content; update the test in the same commit.

## Known Issues

| Issue | Impact | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `STAGES` has no preflight validation | Typos fail only when the stage runs | Add a whitelist before execution |
| Uvicorn host/port settings are startup-time values | Settings UI cannot change the bind of a running bundled sidecar | Add restart/apply flow before promising live LAN mode |
| Free-tier GitHub Actions budget (2,000 min/mo) | Easy to exhaust if new heavy jobs run on every PR | Add new heavy CI jobs to `security.yml`'s schedule or path-filter them; see the "CI Workflows" rules above |
